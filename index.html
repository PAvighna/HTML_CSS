    <h3>  What Is Stockfish?</h3>
    <p>
     Stockfish is the strongest chess engine available to
      the public and has been for a considerable amount of time. It is a free
      open-source engine that is currently developed by an entire community.
      Stockfish was based on a chess engine created by Tord Romstad in 2004 that
      was developed further by Marco Costalba in 2008. Joona Kiiski and Gary
      Linscott are also considered founders.Stockfish is not only the most
      powerful available chess engine but is also extremely accessible. It is
      readily available on many platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux,
      iOS, and Android.
